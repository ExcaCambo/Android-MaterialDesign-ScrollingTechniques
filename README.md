#Scrolling Techniques for Android

##What is this?

This project is a starting point for everybody trying to implement the Scrolling Techniques listed in Google's Material Design Specification. It was implemented using the Android Design Support Library and the latest version of RecyclerView. You can read more about these techniques in Google specification or you can see how I implemented them all in the [tutorial I created for Tutplus+](http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/scrolling-techniques-for-android-apps--cms-24435)(not published yet).

##Installation

Please, don't forget to sync the project after you import it to your workspace.
